This was a lot harder than I would have expected. I kept forgetting to vim into the file.
But I figured it out after I remembered I had to edit in the file. Alt + j moves line down.
Alt + k moves line up. Enter moves on to the next line. :wq to save and exit

Nano was a little confusing at first but I like how the commands are all shown on the buttom.
I did forget that the ^ symbol actually means CTRL though, so that initially caused more problems. 
I feel like vim so far is the best then nano. CTRL + X to exit and then save.

Emacs is easy to start text in but it's not installed in our VM. I am realitively lazy, so I don't plan
on using Emacs. Most likely I will be using vim because you have hyped it up quite a bit. Hold CTRL + x
then release x and press c to quit.
